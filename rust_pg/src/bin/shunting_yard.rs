/**

Pratt Parsing:
- Uses a top-down approach.
- Easier to implement for complex grammars.
- More flexible and can handle more language constructs.
- Can be more efficient for certain types of expressions.

Shunting Yard:
- Uses a bottom-up approach.
- Converts infix expressions to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation).
- Easier to understand and implement for simple arithmetic expressions.
- Generally less flexible for complex grammars.

*/

// The difference between Shunting Yard and Pratt Parser is that Shunting Yard is used to convert infix expression to postfix expression
